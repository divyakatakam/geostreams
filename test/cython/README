This directory shows to examples of how to call a cython function from C.

The [cython
documentation](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/external_C_code.html#using-cython-declarations-from-c)
describes two ways to do this.
    
    cdef public func():
        pass

and 

    cdef api func():
        pass

Since the documentation was a little vague. I have written two examples here.

The difference between `api` and `public` seems to be that the source generated for `public` functions must be explicitly included in the target executable. On the other hand, `api` provides an importing mechanism, so the C or fortran executables only need to include the header `cython_name_api.h` and link against the system python library.
